This is the bachelorâ€™s thesis created by Jens Voortman, Ruben Visser and Vasco de Bruijn for the TI3800 Bachelorproject, which is a compulsory part of the Bachelor Computer Science at the TU Delft. Over the course of ten weeks, we have build a Monitoring System for the exoskeleton made by Project March. Project March is one of the DreamTeams of the TU Delft and was the client of this project.

We would like to thank the team of Project MARCH. We had a great time working with them and we want to wish them good luck in the 2016 Cybathlon.

Finally, we would like to thank our coach, Hennie Huijgens from the SERG Group at the TU Delft. He was very enthusiastic about the project and he gave us valuable feedback on our intermediate reports, so that we could raise the level of our this report.
