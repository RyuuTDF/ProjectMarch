\section{Requirements}\label{sec:req}
Since the problem definition and analysis were concrete enough, it was possible to create a list of requirements directly from them. After meeting with the Client Advisor to discuss this list, the requirements were updated to the current needs and can be found in table \ref{table:requi}. The result will be taken in consideration in the rest of the report.\\
