In this chapter, the results of the research are documented. The research was conducted in the first two weeks of the project. In section \ref{sec:probdef} the given problem will defined and analysed. In section \ref{sec:infra} an overview of the existing infrastructure which is relevant for the given problem is given. This includes an overview of all sensors with their data, the existing EtherCat structure and Simulink structure. In section \ref{sec:devmet} the development method that is used in this project will be explained. In section \ref{sec:req} the requirements for the project are listed. Next in section \ref{sec:suc} the Success Criteria are defined. Section \ref{sec:datatrans} addresses how the system will transfer the data wireless and shows several possible data models which can be used to achieve this. In section \ref{sec:dataproc} it is documented how the data will be processed. In section \ref{sec:ui} the User Interface is discussed, and discusses the way it is implemented. Finally in section \ref{sec:rescon} the conclusions will be described.
