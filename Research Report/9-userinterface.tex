\section{User Interface}
\subsection{Framework}
In order to choose a language, there are two important factors in this project which have to be taken in account. Firstly, the framework should have a rich support of visualising data. Secondly, the framework must be able to support 3D rendering. Keeping this in mind, the options of languages are narrowed down to C/C++, Java \& Python because these are known to have a rich selection of libraries which support 3D rendering and data visualisation. In addition, since SimuLink is a MatLab module, using MatLab as framework is also an option. 
\subsection{3D-Rendering}
Because of the fact that the 3d-rendering has shifted to a lower priority, less effort has been expended in researching suitable frameworks for rendering. Still, a small list have been compiled of some rendering frameworks which are simple to use for each of the narrowed down languages.
\begin{itemize}
	\item C/C++: Ogre3D
	\item Java/Scala: Env3D
	\item Python: Panda3D
\end{itemize}
