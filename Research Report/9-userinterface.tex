\subsection{Framework}
In order to choose a language, there are two imporant factors in this project which have to be taken in account. Firstly, the framework should have a rich support of visualising data. Secondly, the framework must be able to support 3D rendering. Keeping this in mind, the options of langueages are narrowed down to C/C++, Java \& Python because these are known to have a rich selection of libraries which support 3D rendering and data visualisation.
