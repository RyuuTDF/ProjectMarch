\section{Development Methodology}\label{sec:devmet}
\subsection{Scrum}
During the project we will be using Scrum for our scheduling and planning. By employing this method, we will have four sprints of two weeks each in which we can yield deliverables and make sure a short feedback loop can be used. In addition, it will be possible to adjust the schedule according to progress made on the goals to be achieved.

\subsection{MoSCoW}
To assign priorities to various parts of the product we will be making, we are going to use the MoSCoW model. With this we will label the parts of the project with the priorities as mentioned in the table \ref{table:moscow}. By focussing on parts with must have and should have priorities the most important parts will be made and delivered first.\\[1cm]
