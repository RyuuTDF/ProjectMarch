\section{Problem definition \& analysis} \label{sec:probdef}
\subsection{Problem definition}
In 2015, the ``Moving Bird Foundation'' was founded. As part of the foundation, the dream team ``Project MARCH'' was created. The goal of this dream team is designing and building an exoskeleton for paraplegic people, to participate in the `Powered Exoskeleton Race'-discipline of the 2016 Cybathlon in Zurich\footnote{\url{http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/}}. The Cybathlon is the first `Olympics' for disabled athletes using bionic assistive technology.\\ 
The exoskeleton that is being designed has many sensors, which acquire data from their surroundings. Project MARCH wishes to have a system, which allows for external monitoring and visualization of all vital sensor data.

\subsection{Problem Analysis}
During this project the team is tasked to design and implement an external system, that hooks into the existing system and makes the monitoring of the sensors possible. Currently there is no wireless connection, the only way to check the sensor data is by connecting the exoskeleton to an external PC with a LAN-cable. This way of connecting is not preferred, as it has the possibility to impede the movement of the exoskeleton.\\ Furthermore, as it stands now only the raw sensor data can be extracted, which is of no use since this data is unitless. It's important to be able to monitor the sensors in a comprehensible way, as the MARCH-team will be able to stop the exoskeleton faster if anything happens to be failing.
