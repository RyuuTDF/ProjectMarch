\section{Conclusion}
The requirements state that data visualisation has a higher priority than 3D-rendering. Because of this, it is not essential that the chosen framework has an extensive 3D-library. In the end, Matlab was chosen as preferred framework for the GUI for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The required data is sent through SimuLink, which is a module of Matlab. This means that the data does not need to be converted.
	\item Matlab has an extensive collection of data visualisation tools.
	\item Most other applications within Project MARCH also make use of Matlab. Therefore, using Matlab helps future integration and easier continuation.
\end{itemize}
