\subsection{Output Sensors}
The exoskeleton contains five types of sensors.
\subsection{IMU}
An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device that measures and reports a craft's velocity, orientation, and gravitational forces. Each joint of the exoskeleton contains an IMU. Together those IMU's are used to keep track of the position as well as the movement of the legs. The IMU's are also used to calculate the center of mass. 
\subsection{Time of Flight}
A Time of Flight sensors is a device used to measure the distance based on the speed of light/sound. Both feet contain Time of Flight sensors used to measure the distance of the surroundings.
\subsection{Encoders}
An encoder is a device that measures angular position or motion of a shaft or axle. Each joint of the exosceleton contains an encoder. 
\subsection{Force}
The feet contains force sensors in order to measure pressure.
